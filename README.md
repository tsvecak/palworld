## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

It is encouraged to use **pnpm** so the husky hooks can work properly.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Setup ENV to point to your local strapi instance(you can find and clone StrapiCMS project here - [Paldeck Strapi](https://github.com/tsvecak/paldeck-strapi)
```
  STRAPI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1337
```
Note that you will have to add content to Pals List at the minimun, but would highly suggest adding one of each collection to have it running locally.

### 3. Run the development server

You can start the server using this command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
